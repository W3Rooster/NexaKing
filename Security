## 🧠 Smart Contract Security

### 🔍 Smart Contract Audits
- The **NXK token contract** follows Ethereum’s **ERC-20 standard** and has undergone **rigorous internal audits**.
- We **encourage third-party audits** to enhance trust and ensure transparency.
- Contract code is **open-source** and available on **GitHub** and **Etherscan** for public verification.

### 🔒 Immutable Design & Fixed Supply
- **Total Supply:** 21,000,000 NXK (Hard-capped)
- **No minting**, **no burning**, and **no hidden tax mechanisms**
- **No administrative functions** for altering token balances or supply.

## 🔐 Ownership, Renounce & Contract Transparency

### 🔓 Ownership Renounced
- The **smart contract ownership** has been **renounced**, eliminating any privileged control.
- No central authority can change the contract logic or halt trading activity.

### 📜 Verified on Etherscan
- The NXK token smart contract is fully **verified on Etherscan**, allowing anyone to explore and inspect the code.

### 🔎 Open-Source Philosophy
- The source code is **publicly hosted on GitHub** to encourage community reviews, audits, and collaboration.

## 🚨 Anti-Bot & Launch Protections
- Our smart contract includes **anti-bot mechanisms** to prevent sniper bots during initial launch.
- **Buy/sell limits**, **cooldown periods**, and **maximum wallet caps** are implemented to ensure fair distribution.
- **Trading can only be enabled manually** by the deployer after initial liquidity is added, preventing malicious early trades.

## ✅ Verified LP Lock & Transparency
- **Initial liquidity** will be locked using a trusted third-party locker (e.g., **Unicrypt** or **Team Finance**).
- **Liquidity Lock duration** will be transparently shared on all our social and GitHub pages.

## 🧠 Community-Centric Practices

- No VCs.
- No pre-mined advantage.
- 100% fair launch with **public access and transparency**.
