NXK Monthly Report — January 2026 of Nexaking (NXK) token
This report documents final-stage smart-contract hardening, deployment strategy redesign, Safe-only governance enforcement, and Binance-grade trust alignment for NXK during January 2026.
________________________________________
1. Smart Contract Hardening (NXKToken.sol)
•	Continued deep review of NXKToken.sol with focus on:
o	Pair-aware logic
o	DEX-agnostic behavior
o	Blocking dangerous addresses/bots
o	Zero red-flag optics after trading is enabled
•	Finalized global limits:
o	setMaxBuyAmountGlobal
o	setMaxWalletAmountGlobal
•	Confirmed immutable fee model:
o	LP tax 0.25%
o	Dev tax 0.25%
o	Total fee 0.5% forever
•	Removed high-risk features entirely:
o	Manual pause / unpause
o	sniperExempt mapping and setters
o	Blacklist / sniper blacklist logic
•	Kept only time-boxed, launch-only protections:
o	pauseTradingForBlocks (short emergency window)
o	Transfer delay at launch (bounded)
•	Ensured all limits are loosen-only after trading.

2. Transfer Logic & Pair-Aware Design
•	Performed full _transfer() audit (multiple passes).
•	Confirmed:
o	Fees apply only on buys/sells, not wallet transfers
o	Token contract excluded from limits in constructor
o	Primary pair defined as NXK/WETH
•	Removed pauseBypass entirely to avoid hidden control paths.
•	Added explicit errors and optimized if / revert patterns for:
o	Cleaner audits
o	Lower gas
o	Clear UI behavior on failure

3. Vesting Architecture Finalization
•	Migrated fully to OpenZeppelin VestingWallet standard.
•	Introduced VestingWalletFixedAllocation.sol for clarity.
•	Final vesting structure:
o	Team: 24-month cliff + 12-month linear (36months total)
o	Advisor: 24/ 12
o	Stake: 12 / 12
•	Made vesting parameters configurable via .env (network-specific).
•	Confirmed:
o	Vesting Safes excluded from limits and sniping
o	No timelock needed for vesting release
o	Blacklist logic intentionally absent

4. Deployment Strategy Redesign (deploy.ts)
•	Major redesign of deploy.ts to:
o	Avoid EOA admin actions
o	Generate Safe batch JSON payloads instead
o	Match OZ v5 standards
•	Final decisions:
o	Deployment via EOA is acceptable
o	All admin actions after deployment use Safe batches
•	Removed:
o	LP operator EOA (W4) completely
o	Ownership transfer to timelock from deploy.ts
•	All minted tokens (8.4M NXK) now transferred directly to SAFE_LC.
•	Added generation of ordered Safe batch files for:
o	Pair creation
o	Liquidity addition
o	Role configuration
•	Introduced guards to prevent:
o	Re-deployment on mainnet
o	Accidental second pair creation

5. Liquidity & Launch Flow Finalization
•	Final launch order defined:
1.	Deploy contract
2.	Create pair (Safe batch)
3.	Add liquidity directly from SAFE_LC
4.	Start trading promptly
5.	Transfer ownership to Timelock
•	Confirmed:
o	SAFE_LC must hold ETH for liquidity + gas
o	SAFE_LP_HOLDER permanently holds LP tokens
o	Liquidity added in stages, not all at once
•	Chose direct Safe-based liquidity addition as:
o	More trustable
o	MEV-safe
o	Better for Binance optics

6. Timelock & Governance
•	Reviewed NXKTimelock.sol constructor and logic.
•	Kept timelock deployment only (no ownership transfer during deploy).
•	Clarified execution order of Safe batches.
•	Ensured guardian, LP wallet, and governance roles are:
o	Explicit
o	Auditable
o	Non-extendable post-launch
________________________________________
7. Trust, Compliance & Exchange Readiness
•	Evaluated NXK against Binance listing expectations:
o	No hidden pause
o	No blacklist
o	Immutable fees
o	Safe-only admin
o	Transparent liquidity control
•	Produced internal auditor checklist and investor-friendly explanations.
•	Confirmed NXK avoids common DEX red flags.

8. Infrastructure & Operational Notes
•	RPC reliability
•	Hardhat fork safety guards
•	Website and hosting issues escalated to the provider (Namecheap).
•	Prepared documentation for opening new development sessions cleanly.
