NXKToken.sol
•	Updated _update() logic and refined core transfer behavior.
•	Reviewed and updated setSnipeBlockCount (launch-only protection).
•	Updated rescueETH() and rescueERC20() implementations.
•	Applied final edits around L670.
•	Re-evaluated fee behavior across AMM pairs (DEX/CEX compatibility).
•	Completed a full contract review as part of the final review phase.
•	Confirmed keeping pauseTradingForBlocks() as a launch-only emergency safeguard affecting primary-pair buys only.
Code Quality & Documentation
•	Simplified the top-level comment block for clarity and professionalism.
•	Removed unnecessary or ambiguous wording to avoid “experimental” optics.
Deployment Strategy
•	Reviewed deploy.ts flow around trading start and ownership transfer.
•	Re-evaluated timing of transferring ownership to Timelock vs. day-one ownership.
•	Continued assessment of launch-misbehavior scenarios and response options.
Notes
•	Design remains: no centralization risk, Safe-based ownership, pair-aware, DEX-agnostic, and network-aligned.
•	All changes aim to maintain maximum investor trust and clean exchange optics.
Launch Risk Planning (misbehaving launch — d2)
•	Defined and documented “misbehaving launch” concerns and why the first minutes matter.
•	Finalized approach: startTrading executes simultaneously with transferOwnershipToTimelock, while a Safe Guardian retains limited, time-boxed emergency reaction capability.
•	Listed and reviewed major misbehaving-launch categories (bot swarms, failed/blocked buys, liquidity/trading flow issues, unexpected revert patterns).
•	Clarified what “chart stability” means and the expected time window before considering trading behavior stable.
Deploy.ts / NXKToken.sol
•	Identified required code changes to ensure the Safe batch execution triggers startTrading + ownership transfer in the same execution moment.
•	Investigated an Etherscan verify error related to deployment/verification flow.
•	Reviewed how to detect and diagnose launch-time issues:
o	where users see reverts
o	what DEX UIs show vs on-chain revert reasons/logs
o	what monitoring signals to watch during first minutes
Website / Social
•	NexaKing website: footer links corrected (X + Telegram).

Launch Protection & Guardian Logic
•	Reviewed misbehaviour categories during launch:
o	TransferDelay (buy/sell)
o	SellCooldown
o	MaxWallet
o	MaxBuyPerBlock
o	TradingPausedForAMM
•	Clarified that not all launch misbehaviour scenarios require full contract pause.
•	Evaluated using onlyOwnerOrGuardian (launch-only) for selected parameters instead of strict Timelock-only control.
•	Defined enforcement model for Guardian privileges:
o	Emergency window only
o	Loosen-only adjustments
o	One-way lock / freeze after window
Emergency Window Review
•	Reviewed constants:
o	PAUSE_WINDOW_BLOCKS = 30
o	GUARDIAN_EMERGENCY_BLOCKS = 30
•	Discussed whether 30 blocks (~6 minutes) is sufficient or if extension (60–120 blocks) is more practical.
Finalize Lock
•	Removed finalizeLock() function.
•	Confirmed removal of maxBuyPerBlockLocked for cleaner logic.
Anti-Bot Controls
•	Re-evaluated maxBuyPerBlock as launch-only anti-bot measure.
•	Reviewed post-launch handling strategy.
Liquidity & Slippage
•	Clarified the meaning of rational spreads/slippage during launch.
•	Reviewed settings for 2 ETH / 300K NXK liquidity:
o	SLIPPAGE_BPS = 300
o	DEADLINE_SECS = 86400 (24h)
•	Evaluated whether the configuration is suitable for the mainnet.
Red-Flag Testing
•	Researched contract scanning platforms for red-flag detection.
•	Reviewed compatibility of free tools for Sepolia testing.

February 11, 2026
Planning
•	Reorganized NXK roadmap and task execution order.
•	Reviewed overall launch planning chart and milestone sequencing.
Red Flag Review (d2)
•	Researched how investors evaluate token legitimacy:
o	Ownership structure (Timelock / Safe vs EOA)
o	Liquidity safety
o	Fee mutability
o	Hidden admin modifiers
o	Bytecode verification status
•	Reviewed how DEX platforms detect red flags.
•	Identified potential “yellow flag” optics in contract:
o	pauseTradingForBlocks
o	setPreTradingWhitelist
o	setExcludedFromFee
o	setAutomatedMarketMakerPair
•	Decision: These features require clear public documentation to avoid misunderstanding.

Contract & Deployment Review
•	Full re-review of NXKToken.sol and deploy.ts.
•	Removed setExcludedFromMaxWallet for SAFE_GOVERNANCE to reduce unnecessary exemptions.
•	Clarified “Bytecode matches source”:
o	Ensuring Etherscan verification matches the deployed contract exactly.

Launch Parameters Reassessment
•	Evaluated current limits:
o	maxBuy = 4,200
o	maxWallet = 8,400
•	Determined 8,400 maxWallet may frustrate buyers.
•	Updated protection parameters:
o	maxBuyPerBlock = 60,000
o	earlyBps = 15%
o	maxBuyGlobal = 20,000
o	maxWalletGlobal = 80,000
Status
Launch protections, optics, and liquidity sizing are being tuned for smoother distribution, reduced chaos, and stronger investor trust.

Planning
•	Reorganized NXK goals and task execution order.
•	Reviewed and refined overall launch planning chart.
Red Flag Review (d2)
•	Analyzed how investors and buyers evaluate contract legitimacy:
o	Ownership structure (EOA vs Safe vs Timelock)
o	Liquidity safety and control
o	Fee mutability and hidden admin privileges
o	Bytecode verification consistency
•	Reviewed how DEX tools and scanners flag contracts.
•	Identified potential “yellow flag” optics requiring public clarification:
o	pauseTradingForBlocks
o	setPreTradingWhitelist
o	setExcludedFromFee
o	setAutomatedMarketMakerPair
•	Conclusion: Documentation and transparency are required to prevent misinterpretation.
Contract & Deployment Review
•	Performed full re-review of NXKToken.sol and deploy.ts.
•	Removed setExcludedFromMaxWallet for SAFE_GOVERNANCE to reduce unnecessary privilege.
•	Clarified that “Bytecode matches source” means Etherscan verification must exactly match the deployed contract.
Launch Parameters Reassessment
•	Evaluated whether maxWalletGlobal = 8,400 may restrict buyer participation.
•	Reconsidered initial configuration:
o	maxBuy = 4,200
o	maxWallet = 8,400
o	Liquidity: 2 ETH / 300K NXK
•	Decision: 1M NXK liquidity preferred over 300k NXK for smoother distribution.
•	Updated launch protection values:
o	maxBuyPerBlock = 60,000
o	earlyBps = 15%
o	maxBuyGlobal = 20,000
o	maxWalletGlobal = 80,000
Status
Launch configuration is being tuned to balance:
•	Investor trust
•	Reduced red-flag optics
•	Controlled distribution
•	Realistic liquidity constraints

Social — Telegram Configuration
•	Evaluated Telegram structure for NXK launch:
o	Priority order decided:
- Telegram Channel (official announcements)
- Telegram Group (community discussion)
•	Decision: Both Channel and Group are required.
•	Confirmed cross-linking:
o	Group link should appear in Channel profile.
o	Channel link should appear in Group profile.
•	Reviewed why website/GitHub links behave differently in profile previews.
•	Reviewed message permissions:
o	Channel: posting restricted to admins only.
o	Group: members allowed to chat (moderated).
•	Reviewed “Approve New Members” setting:
o	Decision: Keep OFF (reduces friction).
•	Audited channel/group permission configurations for launch readiness.
Red Flag Review (d3)
•	Final decision: earlyBps = 3000 (30%) instead of 1500.
•	Rationale: 30% early limit provides smoother launch behavior and avoids over-restriction during first blocks.
