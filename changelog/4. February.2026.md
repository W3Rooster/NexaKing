•	Evaluated adding a global limiter (block-level throttle).
•	Reviewed rational ETH/NXK ratios for initial liquidity.
•	Defined launch-protection duration (~2 minutes).
•	Designed global buy throttle and per-block limits.
•	Deep analysis of launching with 2 ETH liquidity:
o	Risk expectations
o	Chaos mitigation strategies

•	Decided:
o	2 ETH is possible with strong protections
