### Ecosystem Fund
Not subject to linear vesting. Managed via multisig governance and spent based on project milestones. All transfers are publicly disclosed for transparency.

### Vesting Summary
- **Team & Development:** 24-month cliff, then released linearly over 12 months  
- **Advisors:** 24-month cliff, then released linearly over 12 months  

### Treasury / Governance Transparency (Recommended Policy)
- Ecosystem and Marketing wallets should be controlled by **Safe (multisig) + Timelock** (or an equivalent public-delay policy).
- Spending should be **milestone-based** (deliverable → tranche release).
- Publish a **monthly transparency log**: amount, destination address, reason, and transaction link.
